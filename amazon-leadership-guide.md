# QUESTION: Why Amazon?

I want to move into a Software Engineering role at Amazon for two main reasons.

First, I appreciate that Amazon values ownership and customer obsession. I sincerely believe that Amazon is choosing to build a better long-term future by proactively simplifying the lives of its customers each and every day through technology. For example, the Amazon Macie service uses NLP to automatically monitor databases, flag security risks by communicating them to Eventbridge and then alert businesses on the AWS platform.

Second, I am excited by the idea of working alongside others that are also driven to bring people together and realize greatness on a community and personal level. It sounds like a tremendous opportunity that would expedite my own learning & development. 

# QUESTION: Tell us about a feature you developed from start to finish

As an SE at Choice Hotels, I was tasked with inventing the group payment options on their website.

When I first took on the user story, the details provided conveyed simple if-else logic based on meeting specific conditions.

I quickly learned the scope of the project wasn't adequately understood given that the functionality was going to intertwine with various domains that weren't prepared for such functionality yet given our service-oriented architecture and at the time on-going migration on-premise data center to AWS.

So I expressed my concerns to my PM, who organized virtual-meetings with all the stake holders.

After those meeting, I updated the logic on our backend, validated against my unit tests, and made sure our CDN had the necessary resources

Unfortunately, there were edge cases that I didn't take into account, so my implementation didn't pass QA. I brought up my failure to provide a scalable-solution and one of the stake holders from another domain possessed an excel that visually demonstrated how all 12 possible customer experiences should play out.

After that meeting, I updated my logic and unit tests, worked closely with QA to make sure all possible scenarios were understood and tested.

Once QA was approved, it was successfully tested in canary in both on-premise and cloud environments.

Upon completion of the project, I was again offered an official role with the company. I was a contractor during my tenure as an SE at Choice Hotels.

**2. Can you tell me about a time you obsessed over giving very high quality service to a customer?**

As a manager for a food truck several years ago, I oversaw an employee that prepared the food quickly and efficiently, but was rude to customers. I pulled him aside and told him that he's great at preparing the food, but his treatment of our customers was ruining the experience and rendering his efforts and output moot.

After the shift I told him that if this behavior continues he cannot interact with customers anymore and possibly not be allowed to work on my shifts moving forward, which would reduce his potential earnings. Despite the fact the feedback was said with positive intent, he stormed off and I completed his remaining responsibilities that evening.

**2. Tell me about the most important lesson you learned in the past year.**

The most important lesson I learned this past year is the immeasurable value of trust with a customer. As a paying customer for a salsa dance studio, I became infuriated when I realized that the assistants on the staff where more interested in appearing as always right when providing feedback, even if came at the expense of the student long-term. That breakdown in trust prompted to immediately cancel my membership and seek out a different dance studio to continue my education.

Sometimes out of a need to produce great results, I will start over on a project with lessons learned if it doesn't meet a standard of excellence. In the short term, it will set me back in terms of time, in the long term I will have produced great results.

# Dive Deep

> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
>
> No task is beneath them.

**1. Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.**

Ex) While working at Choice, my production support team heavily relied on tribal knowledge for the weekly deployment of our customer facing application, which made on boarding inefficient. I took it upon myself to document the process and continuously update it to ease on boarding new team members. I had become such a domain expert in our Jenkins deployments, that I was being asked to oversee the training of new hires.

**1. Tell me about an unpopular decision of yours.**

In the evenings, I am training to become a salsa world champion in the group and partner categories. I recently decided to switch to a different dance program despite my $3000 financial investment and the positive relationships I had developed. I made this hard decision because I sincerely believe that if I want to have even a chance a realizing greatness, I need to be in a collaborative environment that confronts the facts by providing honest feedback with positive intent for it's students.

# Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

> Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment.
>
> Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.
>
> They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun.

__Leaders ask themselves:__

- Are my fellow employees growing?

- Are they empowered?

- Are they ready for what's next?

# Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

> We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect.
>
> We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore.
>
> Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

**We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large.**

We must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow.

We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day.
